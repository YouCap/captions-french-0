favorite\r\n\r\n00:04.1100,00:05.4600\r\nmethod to learn vocabulary in any\r\n\r\n00:05.4600,00:07.4700\r\nlanguage because it&#039;s so simple all I\r\n\r\n00:07.4700,00:10.01900\r\nneed is a notebook and a pen and what\r\n\r\n00:10.01900,00:12.2400\r\nyou do is you write lists of 20\r\n\r\n00:12.2400,00:14.0700\r\nexpressions every day in the language\r\n\r\n00:14.0700,00:15.3600\r\nwhich you want to learn and their\r\n\r\n00:15.3600,00:17.5800\r\ntranslation into your mother tongue and\r\n\r\n00:17.5800,00:19.61900\r\nthen next day you write another list of\r\n\r\n00:19.61900,00:21.9300\r\nthose words new words and another list\r\n\r\n00:21.9300,00:23.8500\r\netc etc you don&#039;t do anything else and\r\n\r\n00:23.8500,00:26.7600\r\nthen 2 weeks from the first day you get\r\n\r\n00:26.7600,00:28.8300\r\nback to the list and you test yourself\r\n\r\n00:28.8300,00:30.59900\r\nto see how many of those words you\r\n\r\n00:30.59900,00:32.5500\r\nremember and I know it sounds crazy\r\n\r\n00:32.5500,00:34.2900\r\nbecause you didn&#039;t learn those words\r\n\r\n00:34.2900,00:35.9100\r\nright but this is exactly how this\r\n\r\n00:35.9100,00:37.800\r\nmethod works you&#039;re not supposed to\r\n\r\n00:37.800,00:40.1400\r\nlearn anything you just write them down\r\n\r\n00:40.1400,00:42.71900\r\ninto your notepad that&#039;s all and when\r\n\r\n00:42.71900,00:44.6400\r\nyou test yourself 2 weeks later you will\r\n\r\n00:44.6400,00:47.7600\r\nactually find out that you remember 30%\r\n\r\n00:47.7600,00:49.7700\r\nof those words and what you do with the\r\n\r\n00:49.7700,00:52.19900\r\nrest of those words is you rewrite them\r\n\r\n00:52.19900,00:54.32900\r\non the other side of the paper so this\r\n\r\n00:54.32900,00:56.2800\r\nlist turns into this list in a bit\r\n\r\n00:56.2800,00:58.7100\r\nshorter way and then 2 weeks from this\r\n\r\n00:58.7100,01:01.799999999999997200\r\nlist you again test yourself and you\r\n\r\n01:01.799999999999997200,01:03.570000000000000300\r\nwrite 70% of those words which you\r\n\r\n01:03.570000000000000300,01:05.64000000000000100\r\ndidn&#039;t know in here and then the same\r\n\r\n01:05.64000000000000100,01:07.20000000000000300\r\nthing happens in there and this is what\r\n\r\n01:07.20000000000000300,01:10.17000000000000200\r\nyou do every day with every list it&#039;s\r\n\r\n01:10.17000000000000200,01:11.84999999999999400\r\nreally simple and I know it sounds crazy\r\n\r\n01:11.84999999999999400,01:14.15900000000000600\r\nbut I swear this method works really\r\n\r\n01:14.15900000000000600,01:17.48999999999999500\r\namazingly this learning is based on your\r\n\r\n01:17.48999999999999500,01:19.29000000000000600\r\nlong-term memory so when you test\r\n\r\n01:19.29000000000000600,01:21.0300\r\nyourself after 2 weeks without seeing\r\n\r\n01:21.0300,01:22.79900000000000700\r\nthose words in those two weeks you will\r\n\r\n01:22.79900000000000700,01:24.95999999999999400\r\nactually see which of those words got\r\n\r\n01:24.95999999999999400,01:27.29900000000000700\r\nstuck in your long-term memory and so we\r\n\r\n01:27.29900000000000700,01:29.2200\r\nonly work with the ones which you don&#039;t\r\n\r\n01:29.2200,01:32.40000000000000600\r\nknow I know it sounds a bit unbelievable\r\n\r\n01:32.40000000000000600,01:34.5300\r\nbut believe me if you try the method out\r\n\r\n01:34.5300,01:36.50900\r\nyou will see that it works now many\r\n\r\n01:36.50900,01:37.9200\r\npeople ask me a lot of questions about\r\n\r\n01:37.9200,01:39.8400\r\nso where do I write it
